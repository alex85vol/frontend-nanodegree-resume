If the JavaScript is loaded first and it is supposed to affect the HTML below it, it might not work, as the JavaScript would be loaded before the HTML it is supposed to work on. Therefore, putting JavaScript near the bottom of the HTML page is often the best strategy."

+  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
+  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
+  about what is actually visible on a website.
+
+  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
+  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
+  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
+  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
+  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
+  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
+  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
